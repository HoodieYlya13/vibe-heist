# Vibe Heist (Monorepo Root) 🕵️‍♂️

**Status:** 🚧 In Active Development

This is the public root repository for the _Vibe Heist_ open-world browser game, powered by **WebGPU** and **WebAssembly**. It orchestrates the submodules and the private game client.

## ✨ About Vibe Heist

_Vibe Heist_ is an ambitious project to create a photoreal open-world driving and action game that runs entirely in the browser. We are rejecting standard web game patterns in favor of a native-performance architecture, and we are not targeting low-end hardware.

### 🏎️ Tech Highlights
- **Native Performance:** The core game simulation is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for high-speed execution.
- **Next-Gen Web Graphics:** Rendering is powered by Babylon.js on **WebGPU**: HDR pipeline, physically based sky and materials, cascaded shadows, screen-space reflections and occlusion, temporal antialiasing.
- **A generated city:** streets, blocks and buildings are planned from data and meshed per streaming chunk — no building kit.
- **Extreme Decoupling (Shared Memory):** The simulation "brain" (Rust) and the visual "eyes" (JS/Babylon) are strictly separated. JavaScript is kept minimal and acts merely as the "glue". To avoid slow message passing, both layers read from the same shared memory buffer (RAM), allowing zero-copy communication at native speeds.

## 📂 Structure

- **`sim/` (Submodule)**: Public Rust physics engine.
- **`web/` (Submodule)**: Public Next.js launcher & marketing site.
- **`client/` (Private Submodule)**: The core TypeScript game logic, assets, and netcode.
- **`vercel-build.sh`**: The master deployment script.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> **Collaborator Access Only:** Because the `client` directory is a private submodule, only invited collaborators with access to that repository can pull the code and run this project locally. However, the public can still play the live version!

### 1. Initialize Submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Build the Simulation Engine

The client imports the WASM package from `sim/pkg` and the generated layout constants, so build the engine first (prerequisites: Rust + `wasm-pack`):

```bash
cd sim
cargo run --bin gen_layout   # emits client/src/generated/sim-layout.ts
wasm-pack build --target web # emits sim/pkg
```

### 3. Run the Game (Local Dev)

```bash
cd client
npm install && npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel (Production)

Pushing to `main` triggers the `vercel-build.sh` script, which regenerates the shared layout constants, compiles the Rust engine, builds the game client, and injects the artifacts into the Next.js web portal.

## ✅ Continuous Integration

CI lives in the submodules, next to the code it tests:

- **`sim`**: `cargo fmt` / `clippy -D warnings` / `cargo test` (deterministic vehicle replay tests) on every push.
- **`client`**: `tsc --noEmit` type check on every push (the local `sim` WASM package is stubbed, so no Rust toolchain is needed). Headless WebGPU smoke tests run locally with `npm run test:smoke`.

## 🤖 Working with AI agents

Agent instructions live in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md); the product direction and roadmap live in the client repository (`client/PRD.md`, `client/ROADMAP.md`).
